# Object-oriented programming in Python

Object-oriented programming (OOP) means that programs have a strong tendency of being organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. That means a class represents the idea or concept behind something more tangible, like an actual object reasonably specific to your business. For example, when working on an education app, a class could be a student, teacher, or classroom.

With Python, it certainly can be used as a scripting language, it is designed as an object-oriented programming language.
